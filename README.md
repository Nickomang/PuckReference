What is PuckReference?
------

PuckReference is a Chrome browser extension that integrates RotoWorld and Hockey-Reference into the ESPN Fantasy Hockey website. It's being actively developed, so more features are on the way.

How does it work?
------

FantasyGraph scans through your league's team clubhouse, free agency, and trade pages looking in specific places for player names. Whenever a player is found, the extension inserts a link to that player's profile on RotoWorld and Hockey-Reference. The result will look like this: ![PuckReference Screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/27tcCKd.png?1 "PuckReference Screenshot") 

Each icon acts as a link to that player's page. From there you can get RotoWorld's unique insight and look at much more in-depth stats than the ones offered by ESPN on Hockey-Reference.
